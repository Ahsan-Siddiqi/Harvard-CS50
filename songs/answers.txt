To show a listener's audio aura, I would map the average values for energy, valence, danceability, loudness, speechiness, and length to two moods.
While speechiness and lesser valence may indicate a reflective mood, high energy, valence, and danceability may indicate a cheerful mood.
For many reasons, though, this approach may not be very representative of the listener.
It simplifies complex emotions into two moods, thereby possibly excluding musical preferences.
Second, the mean values might not capture the atmosphere of a song. Thirdly, one overlooks song contextâ€”that is, working out against resting.
Examining song time in each category and grouping songs based on mood can help to enhance aura computation.
Additionally personalizing and faithfully capturing the auditory aura of the listener are user comments and emotional tagging of music.
